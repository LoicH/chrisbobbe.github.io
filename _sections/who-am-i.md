I'm a data science student, I've finished my studies and currently in my internship.

I did my Engineering Master in [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng/international-studies/master-of-engineering/postgraduate-program/data-science.html) and Université Pierre et Marie Curie, two big French schools. My Master was in Computer Science, with a Data Science specialization.

I am finishing a two-year apprenticeship/internship at [Trusted Labs](http://trusted-labs.com/), where I am developing software and improving security attacks using machine learning techniques.

I really like challenging projects where I can improve my technical skills. I love to solve original problems, I am curious and well-organized, I like to deliver high-quality products.

I am interested about data science opportunities in France, Portugal or Spain.
