<p>I'm a front-end web developer!</p>
<p>I'm currently making lots of open-source web templates into Jekyll themes
so more people can use them. I also make intuitive user interfaces
with Angular and React. I started coding when I was nine and kept it up
through college where I did an English degree. My creative and
analytical skills might be a great fit for your project, especially
if it means taking something old and clunky and making it shiny, responsive,
and accessible.</p>
