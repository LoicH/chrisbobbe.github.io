# Here are some things I can do.

* Migrate a web app's routing system from React Router 3 to 4
  * Routes are defined in the components themselves!
  * Follow best practices in React
    * with views founded on a component hierarchy where [data flows down](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
    * by taking full advantage of React before (carefully) adding Redux
* Add a book tagging feature to an experimental book-publishing web app in **Java** [^1]
  * with an MVC pattern based on Java objects, .jsp files, and servlets
  * using DAO interfaces, implemented in classes, to send prepared statements to a PostgreSQL database
  * after designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to describe database structure
* Deploy a WordPress website
  * to Heroku, and connect it to an Amazon RDS instance running MySQL with an SSL connection
    * with keys and passwords stored in Heroku Config Variables
  * to WordPress.org with a hosting provider such as Bluehost
  * to WordPress.com
* Create a static Jekyll website and deploy it to GitHub Pages
  * and revamp the theme with Sass
* Use JQuery to make views responsive
* Make myself more productive with my own code
  * One script uses the Gmail API to tell me when to unsubscribe from email lists I never read
  * Another implements a "find-X-largest-threads" method, using binary search, to give me batches of large email threads I can delete
  * A custom TypeScript app in IFTTT connects my FitBit with the productivity tracker Beeminder to make sure I sleep enough
